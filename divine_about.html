I am a chef, aviation geek, mandala artist, food photographer but above all a BAKER! 
I have  my Bachelors  Degree in  Culinery Arts from Sheila  Rhaheja, Bandra  Campus.
Baking has always been my passion and has always fasicnated me. Opening and running 
my own business has given me great exposure and has been one of its kind of learning 
experience. The journey started about three years back when i started a food page on 
Instagram  named  'KH_se_Kahana'. I am in love with my job and wake up with a  smile 
everyday thinking about how I am living the life of my dreams. Meeting happy customers 
and interactibg with them is my favorite part of this job!</div>

Cooking is my passion and baking is my hobby!
I am an admirer of how raw and simple ingredients mix and form magically desserts. 
I pursued a degree in Culinary Arts from D.Y.Patil university. I have been baking 
since I was six and since then I have participated in  over 50 baking and cooking 
challenges.  My passion  for baking  has driven  me to start with this venture. I
love going to the bakery and helping out customers find out exactly what they are 
looking for. The satisfaction  of helping a customer buy their dream wedding cake 
or their kid's first birthday cake is surreal!

Baking and cooking are two things that keep me going. I bake when I'm happy. I bake when I'm sad. I always bake.
I studied Culinery Arts from SRHM college. My go to dishes are overloaded chocolate chip cookies, hot brownnies 
with vanilla ice cream and chocolate suace and salted caramel ice cream. My first encounter with bakery was in 2006
when I visited the biggest bakery in Paris. After that I couldn't stop thinking about desserts, breads and chocolates.
